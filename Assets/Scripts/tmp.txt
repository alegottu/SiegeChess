Known bugs:
- Moves that put King into check not properly removed
- Player allowed to make moves that don't resolve check; check is removed on next player's move incorrectly

Improvements:
- Flip board after each turn? Maybe an option to do so, or at least an indiction of whose turn it is
- Highlight possible moves in some way
- Do click on event instead of polling in Update at all times
- Some kind of indication for an attempt on an illegal move

Most likely solved:
- Click one piece, then another piece, try illegal move: the original piece makes that move (if legal for that piece)
- Click one piece, try illegal move, click another piece, then another, make a legal move: the piece that should move is eaten up, and the second to last piece actually makes the move

Solved:
- One player allowed to infinitely make moves

Already improved:
- Instead of event based system, call the code directly on the cell that is hit in ClickSelecter
